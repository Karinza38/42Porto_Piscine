 # 42Porto
## Description
* This repository contains my version of completed tasks for the "Piscine C" of December 2023 in 42Porto.
* At the moment, work has been done to check the tasks for correct operation of the folders from C00 to C09 inclusive.
* Each folder contains a pdf file with assignments written in Portuguese.
* Also, in each folder itself there will be subfolders containing a single .c source file (or group of files) with the required name, storing within themselves the execution of the required task.
* The folder of the completed task may contain a test file or a folder with test files, by compiling which you can see how the function (or several functions) required in the task works.
## Compilation
To compile, for example, a file `test.c` containing written source code in C language for a program, you need to write in your terminal:
```
cc test.c
```
The executable file of the program will appear in the directory you went to through the terminal window before compilation (in which you compiled the source code file).
